            <p>Mr.Cho helps me pass my abrsm grade 5. He is so patient to teach me in order to develop the technique. He
                never in rush to teach me. Now I'm ready to play another Chopin's pieces properly</p>

            <p>Mr.Fahrezi is a good and funny tutor. He never ran out of methods that I could understand how to read a
                sheetmusic. By making funny abbreviations so it is are easier to remember how to read. he was very
                patient in teaching me how to play the piano properly.

            <p>He is a genius! He could make me understand how to play piano properly. He also a very patient tutor,
                helped me a lot through my mistakes and turned me into a confident piano player. I wasn't in a proper
                position for playing piano. Also, I love the way he teached me how to count beats, it takes one minute
                to make me understand.</p>

            <p>He is the best pianist and tutor in the world! The way he teach me was so efective. He always teach me
                the right technique to play so i wouldn't easy to get pain in my arms. Im amazed with his playing. His
                level and style is unprecedentedly well, unique, while keeping a very simple, methodological teaching
                method. 100% recommended. </p>

            <p>He is always on time to come to my house. He is so cool that he could play scales so fast and it is
                fascinating to watch. He never got mad when I wrong play scales and helped me get through on the problem
                in learning scales.</p>
